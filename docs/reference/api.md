# API reference

Aixle Flow exposes a REST API under `/api/v1`, plus webhook receivers
for Git host events. A live OpenAPI explorer is served from the running
app itself.

## OpenAPI explorer

When the app is running locally, browse to:

```
http://localhost:4000/docs
```

This is the auto-generated, always-up-to-date schema for every
endpoint. Use this as the canonical source — the tables below give you
the shape, but the explorer has the full request/response specs and
lets you try calls inline.

> The `/docs` endpoint is protected by HTTP Basic Auth in non-dev
> environments. Set `DOCS_LOGIN` and `DOCS_PASSWORD` env vars to
> configure credentials.

## Authentication

Most endpoints are session-authenticated (cookie). Sign in via the web
UI first, then your browser session is good for the API too.

Two endpoints are explicitly **unauthenticated** and verified via HMAC
signature instead:

| Endpoint                  | Verification                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /webhooks/github`   | HMAC SHA-256 using `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.         |
| `POST /webhooks/gitlab`   | Per-repository token in `X-Gitlab-Token` header.    |

Internal endpoints (`/api/v1/internal/*`) are reserved for agent
containers and use a different token mechanism (`ws_auth`).

## REST surface — by resource

### Workflows

```
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:id
PATCH  /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:id
DELETE /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:id

GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps
POST   /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps
PATCH  /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps/reorder
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps/:id
PATCH  /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps/:id
DELETE /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflows/:wf_id/steps/:id
```

Company-scoped workflows live at `/api/v1/workflows/...` (same shape,
no `:project_id`).

### Workflow runs

Run lifecycle actions live in the **web** namespace (they back the
Inertia-rendered UI). They're documented here because they're stable
and you can call them from a session-authenticated client:

```
POST /company/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs                  (start a run)
POST /company/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:id/cancel
POST /company/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:id/approve_step
POST /company/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:id/retry_step
POST /company/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:id/skip_step
```

Asset endpoints for a workflow run are in `/api/v1`:

```
GET  /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:run_id/workflow_run_assets
POST /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:run_id/workflow_run_assets/export_all
POST /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:run_id/workflow_run_assets/:id/export
GET  /api/v1/projects/:project_id/workflow_runs/:run_id/workflow_run_assets/:id/download
```

### Terminal sessions

```
GET    /api/v1/terminal_sessions/:id
POST   /api/v1/terminal_sessions
DELETE /api/v1/terminal_sessions/:id
POST   /api/v1/terminal_sessions/:id/finish
```

GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:id/workflow_runs

GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/comments
POST   /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/comments
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/assets
POST   /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/assets
DELETE /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/assets/:id
DELETE /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/waits/:id
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/transitions
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/activities
GET    /api/v1/projects/:project_id/board/tasks/:task_id/statistics
```

`GET .../board/tasks` is the board's pagination endpoint — the board page
props carry only the first page of each column, and the column pulls the
rest from here as it is scrolled:

| Query param                            | Meaning                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `board_column_id`                      | Restrict to one column.                                             |
| `limit` / `offset`                     | Page window, ordered by `position` then `id`.                       |
| `q[title_cont]`, `q[assignee_id_eq]`, … | Ransack predicates over `BoardTask.ransackable_attributes`.         |
| `tags[]` + `tags_match=all`            | Tag filter. Default matches any listed tag; `all` requires them all. |
| `archived`                             | `archived` for archived only, `all` for both; default active only.   |

The response carries the **unpaginated** match count in the
`X-Total-Count` header, which is how a column header shows its real total
while holding a single page.

## Real-time

| Channel                          | What it streams                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ActionCable at `/cable`          | Board updates, workflow run progress, terminal session output. |
| ActionMCP at `/action_mcp`       | Internal Model Context Protocol endpoint for agent containers. |

## Webhooks

| Endpoint                  | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /webhooks/github`   | Push, pull_request, check_run events from GitHub App.  |
| `POST /webhooks/gitlab`   | GitLab project event hooks.                            |

See [user-guide/integrations.md](../user-guide/integrations.md) for
how to wire these up.

## Versioning

The API is versioned at the path level (`/api/v1/...`). Breaking
changes within `v1` are avoided. New major versions will be additive
(`v2` mounted alongside `v1`). See [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) for
API stability status.

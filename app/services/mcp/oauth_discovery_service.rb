module MCP
  # Discovers an MCP server's OAuth 2.1 configuration and prepares a persisted
  # client for the authorize flow, per the MCP authorization spec:
  #
  #   (a) probe the MCP url                → RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata
  #   (b) fetch authorization-server meta  → RFC 8414 / OIDC discovery endpoints
  #   (c) dynamic client registration      → RFC 7591 (persisted source:"dcr" client)
  #
  # This is the Rails-owned analogue of 1MCP's SDKOAuthClientProvider
  # (oauth-unification.md §5) but with PER-TENANT identity — which 1MCP lacks
  # (it keys tokens by server name only). The persisted client is reused across
  # connects; per-user/per-scope credentials are handled downstream by
  # Oauth::TokenService / OauthCredential.
  #
  # ============================ SSRF DOCTRINE ============================
  # Phase 1's OAuth endpoints came only from the trusted Oauth::Providers
  # registry (zero SSRF surface). Discovery BREAKS that invariant: EVERY url
  # here is attacker-influenced — a user-pasted MCP url, a WWW-Authenticate
  # header, RFC 9728 / 8414 JSON, and the DCR response. Treat all of it as
  # hostile. The rules, enforced by #guard! and #safe_fetch:
  #
  #   1. Validate before EVERY fetch. UrlSafetyValidator.errors_for(url,
  #      require_https: true) — no exceptions — for the MCP url, the PRM url,
  #      EVERY authorization_servers entry, the ASM metadata url, the
  #      authorization/token/registration endpoints, and any DCR-echoed
  #      redirect_uris/client_uri. require_https rejects http, blocked hosts,
  #      literal private/loopback/link-local IPs, and hostnames that DNS-resolve
  #      into private space.
  #   2. Re-validate on EVERY redirect hop. Redirects are followed manually
  #      (Net::HTTP does not auto-follow); each Location is guarded before the
  #      next request. Capped at MAX_REDIRECTS hops.
  #   3. Validate at time-of-USE. A persisted dcr endpoint is still
  #      attacker-authored: a reused client re-guards its endpoints, and
  #      Oauth::TokenService re-guards token_endpoint before every refresh
  #      (that check lives in WIRING, not here).
  #   4. Response limits: TIMEOUT connect/read timeout; MAX_BYTES body cap read
  #      capped (Content-Length is not trusted); non-2xx rejected except the
  #      deliberate probe in step (a) and the DCR POST in step (c), whose failure
  #      body is read for an allowlisted RFC 7591 error code and nothing else.
  #   5. No secrets/metadata in logs. Discovered metadata may embed tokens/urls;
  #      exceptions carry only a host + status, never a body or a full url.
  #   6. DNS pinning caveat (TOCTOU): errors_for resolves, then the HTTP client
  #      resolves AGAIN. Where feasible the validated public IPv4 is pinned into
  #      the request (UrlSafetyValidator.resolve_public_ipv4); the redirect cap +
  #      per-hop re-validation are the always-present backstop when pinning is
  #      unavailable.

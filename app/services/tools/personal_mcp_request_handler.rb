        # Building an Aixle workflow

        A workflow is an ordered set of steps. Each step runs an agent in a
        container with the tools, skills, MCP servers and files you give it.
        Steps can depend on other steps (a DAG), and each step can carry
        sub-steps — a checklist the agent ticks off as it works.

        Build top-down, and prefer inspecting before mutating:

        1. `list_projects` — pick the project; every workflow tool takes its `project_id`.
        2. `list_workflows` / `get_workflow` — see what already exists before adding.
           `get_workflow` also reports the workflow's base resources (tools, skills
           and MCP servers every step gets) — read them before wiring per-step ones.
        3. `create_workflow` — name + description. Returns the `workflow_id`.
           `update_workflow` renames it and sets the base resources.
           `duplicate_workflow` copies an existing one, into this project or another.
        4. Inspect what you can wire in: `list_project_tools`, `list_skills`,
           `list_mcp_servers`, `list_agents`. `get_agent`, `get_skill` and
           `get_mcp_server` return the full persona / skill content / server wiring
           when the list entry isn't enough to decide. Nothing suitable in the
           project yet? Add it from the public catalogs first:
           `search_connector_catalog` → `get_connector` → `install_connector` for
           MCP servers, `search_skill_registry` → `get_registry_skill` →
           `install_skill` for skills. Read the entry before installing — a
           connector's install target decides what runs, and a skill's SKILL.md is
           prompt text your agents will follow.
        5. For each step: `create_workflow_step` takes the wiring in one call —
           name, instructions, agent_id, position, plus `tool_ids`, `skill_ids`,
           `mcp_server_ids`, `depends_on_step_ids`, `bmad_enabled` and
           `allow_non_interactive`. Dependencies must already exist, so create
           the steps they point at first (or set them later with
           `update_workflow_step`).
        6. `create_sub_step` — break a step into a checklist when it has several
           distinct deliverables. `update_sub_step` / `delete_sub_step` /
           `reorder_sub_steps` edit, remove and reorder them; all take the
           `sub_step_id`s reported by `get_workflow_step`. See the `author_step`
           prompt for how to write a good step.
        7. `reorder_workflow_steps` — fix execution order by passing step ids.
        8. Connect a trigger, or the workflow only ever starts by hand:
           `create_workflow_trigger` with a `kind` —
           `column` (a card entering a board column), `slack` (an inbound message),
           `schedule` (cron), `webhook` (an inbound HTTP call, which also returns the
           endpoint URL and secret), or `event` (a custom platform event).
           `list_workflow_triggers` / `update_workflow_trigger` /
           `delete_workflow_trigger` manage them.
        9. `trigger_workflow` — start a run by hand (interactive or non_interactive).
           Track it with `list_workflow_runs` / `get_workflow_run`; read a single
           step run's error, retries and session diagnostics with `get_step_run`;
           stop a run with `cancel_workflow_run`.

        Rules:
        - Ask the user before destructive actions (`delete_workflow`,
          `delete_workflow_step`, `delete_sub_step`, `delete_workflow_trigger`).
        - `get_workflow` truncates step instructions. Read a step with
          `get_workflow_step` before editing it, or you will overwrite text you
          never saw. The same applies to every id list (`tool_ids`, `skill_ids`,
          `mcp_server_ids`, `depends_on_step_ids`, and the workflow's `base_*`
          lists): an update REPLACES the list, so read the current value first.
        - The off-board trigger kinds (slack, schedule, webhook, event) fire with
          nobody watching, so every step must have `allow_non_interactive` set.
          A trigger whose workflow still has a human-gated step is rejected on
          save, and the error names the steps.
        - A `schedule` trigger needs a cron expression AND an explicit timezone —
          leave the timezone out and Temporal schedules in UTC, which drifts by an
          hour under daylight saving.
        - Everything is scoped to what your account can access — a tool that
          returns "not allowed" means your role can't do that in this project.

        # Writing a good Aixle workflow step

        A step is one unit of agent work. Use `create_workflow_step` /
        `update_workflow_step`; break it into `create_sub_step` items when it has
        multiple deliverables.

        Instructions (the `instructions` field, markdown):
        - Say WHAT to do and WHAT to produce — the concrete deliverable and where
          it goes. Be specific about output files/paths.
        - Do NOT restate platform mechanics: session-completion rules, /workspace
          layout, sub-step tracking, or which tools are available. The platform
          injects those automatically — repeating them wastes context.
        - Keep it focused on this step alone; earlier steps' outputs are available
          to later steps that depend on them.

        Wiring:
        - `agent_id` (from `list_agents`) picks who runs the step. `get_agent`
          returns that agent's full persona when the title isn't enough.
        - `tool_ids` / `skill_ids` / `mcp_server_ids` grant capabilities — attach
          only what the step needs (list them with list_project_tools / list_skills /
          list_mcp_servers, and read a skill's content with `get_skill` before
          deciding). Check the workflow's `base_*` lists in `get_workflow` first:
          those already apply to every step, so don't re-attach them here.
        - `depends_on_step_ids` builds the DAG: a step runs after every step it
          depends on. A step can't be deleted while others depend on it.
        - `allow_non_interactive` lets the step run unattended. Every step needs it
          before a slack / schedule / webhook trigger can be attached to the
          workflow.
        - Each of those id lists is REPLACED wholesale by an update — read the
          current value with `get_workflow_step` before changing one.

        Sub-steps:
        - One `create_sub_step` per distinct, checkable deliverable.
        - `required: false` for optional work.
        - The running agent marks them off, giving progress visibility.
        - `get_workflow_step` reports each sub-step's id; edit one with
          `update_sub_step` (name, instructions, position, required), drop one with
          `delete_sub_step`, and fix the order with `reorder_sub_steps` (which
          takes every sub-step id of the step).

        Prefer `get_workflow` to inspect the current shape and `get_workflow_step`
        to read a step in full before editing, and make one focused change per
        tool call.

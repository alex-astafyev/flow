module Coder
  # DeadWorkspaceReaper — deletes pool workspaces whose agent is never coming
  # back.
  #
  # The pool runs on EC2 spot. When an instance is reclaimed, the interruption
  # handler halts the box and tells Coder nothing, and the agent is a cloud-init
  # child rather than a service, so it does not come back on a reboot either.
  # What Coder is left holding is a workspace whose LAST BUILD is still a
  # succeeded `start` — status "running", by the only definition the API has —
  # with every agent on it reporting `disconnected`. Nothing in this codebase
  # ever restarted or recycled such a workspace, so it stayed in the pool
  # forever and the effective pool decayed with the interruption rate. This is
  # the background process that closes that loop.
  #
  # Deleting a workspace is irreversible, so the bar for "it is dead" is set
  # deliberately high. All five must hold, and the last one twice:
  #
  #   1. Coder's own last build for it is a SUCCEEDED START. A stopped, deleting
  #      or mid-build workspace has no agent by design and is never a candidate
  #      — getting this wrong would delete the pool every time it is scaled down.
  #   2. Every agent on it explicitly reports `disconnected`/`timeout`
  #      (`HealthCheck.agents_unhealthy?`). Per § D-0 absence of agent data is
  #      never evidence: a workspace that reports no agents at all is left alone.
  #   3. No live lock is held on it. A session's box is never reaped underneath
  #      it, whatever Coder thinks of its agent.
  #   4. An SSH probe fails to REACH it. An overloaded box also probes `sick`,
  #      and it answered — it is alive and stays. A probe that fails on OUR side
  #      (no `coder` CLI, auth) resolves to `:unknown` and blocks the deletion,
  #      which is also why disabling `health_probe_enabled` disables reaping.
  #   5. All of the above held once before, at least `confirmation_minutes` ago.
  #      One sighting is a snapshot; two, spaced apart, with anything alive in
  #      between clearing the marker, is a diagnosis. Same doctrine as
  #      `Activities::Session::ScanDeadContainersActivity`.
  #
  # Blast radius is bounded on top of that by `max_deletions_per_run`: the
  # failure mode that matters is a fault on our side reading as a dead pool, and
  # a cap turns "deleted everything" into "deleted a few, and said so".
  #
  # First sightings are recorded in `integration_data` as
  # `coder:workspace_dead:<workspace_name>` — same table, TTL semantics and
  # `(integration_id, key)` isolation as the lock and quarantine markers.

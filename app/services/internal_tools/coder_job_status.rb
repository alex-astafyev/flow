                  "`exited` means the command and everything in its process group were reaped, never merely " \
                  "signalled: a cancelled job stays `running` until the whole command group has really ended, " \

                  "infrastructure failure leave identical evidence, so it also carries `possible_causes` and its " \
                  "`diagnosis` names both instead of asserting one — and `command_group_alive` tells you when " \
                  "the wrapper died but the command (`command_pgid`) is still running on the workspace."

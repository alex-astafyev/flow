# The unified "Sessions & Runs" list.
#
# Standalone agent sessions and workflow runs used to live on two pages with two
# controllers, two filter sets and two orderings, and there was no way to see
# "what did this project run yesterday" in one place. This builds one feed of
# both, newest first, with workflow-step sessions folded UNDER their run instead
# of competing with it for a top-level row.
#
# Ordering has to happen in SQL across both tables (you cannot paginate a feed
# you sorted in Ruby), so the spine is a UNION ALL of (id, kind, created_at).
# The page of ids that comes back is then hydrated with the associations each
# kind needs, and re-ordered to match.

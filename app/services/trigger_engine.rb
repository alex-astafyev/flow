# frozen_string_literal: true

# TriggerEngine is the single "brain" of the event-driven trigger layer.
#
# Every trigger source converges here instead of each one hard-coding its own
# call into WorkflowService.start:
#
#   • column auto-binding   → TaskService.check_auto_trigger → record_column_trigger → dispatch_pending
#   • task gate resolution  → TaskService.resolve_gate/remove_gate → record_column_trigger → dispatch_pending
#   • manual launch button  → TaskService.trigger_workflow → record_event + dispatch_pending
#   • Slack / webhook        → Webhooks::ProcessEventJob → publish (record + dispatch_pending)
#   • schedule              → FireScheduleTriggerActivity → record_event + fire_for_binding
#
# Transactional outbox: internal producers record a "pending" TriggerEvent INSIDE
# the same DB transaction as their domain write, then dispatch it inline (the
# happy path). If the process dies after the commit but before/while dispatching,
# the event is left "pending" and OutboxRelay (a Temporal cron) sweeps it later
# and dispatches it. Double-firing is prevented by the TriggerDispatch unique
# dedup_key, which is stable per (event, target) across inline + relay retries.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. record_event   — persist a normalized TriggerEvent (audit / replay / outbox).
#   2. dispatch_pending — route a recorded event to its target(s) once, then mark it
#                         dispatched; the single entry point shared by the inline
#                         path and the relay.
#   3. fire_*         — start a workflow once, idempotently (TriggerDispatch ledger),
#                       always through the existing WorkflowService.start.

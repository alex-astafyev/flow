# frozen_string_literal: true

# The reconciliation side of CI gates. Webhooks are the happy path: a completed
# check suite / workflow run / pipeline arrives, `GateService` resolves the gate,
# and the column auto-trigger re-evaluates. That path has no recovery of its own —
# a delivery that never arrives, a run that was deleted, a repository that was
# detached from the project all leave the gate `pending` forever, which stops the
# task's automation permanently and silently.
#
# This sweep — driven by a Temporal cron (see `Workflows::GateReconciliationWorkflow`)
# — closes that hole. For every pending CI gate past the grace window it asks the
# provider what actually happened (`Ci::GateProbe`) and then does exactly one of
# four things:
#
#   completed     → resolve with the provider's own verdict, same as the webhook
#                   would have (`TaskService.resolve_gate_by_reconciliation`)
#   in_progress   → nothing, unless the gate's TTL has run out
#   unresolvable  → mark stale immediately; no webhook can ever resolve it
#   unavailable   → nothing, unless the gate's TTL has run out (transient)
#
# and records the outcome on the gate either way, so a gate's
# `reconciliation_log` explains what was seen and when.
#
# Every one of those transitions is a compare-and-set on a still-`pending` row
# (`TaskService.with_pending_gate`), and gates are claimed durably before the
# provider call. The sweep therefore never overwrites a verdict that the gate's
# own webhook — or a second sweeper — landed while it was probing; it records the
# overlap as `superseded:<status>` and moves on.
#
# It never invents a passing conclusion: an expired or unresolvable gate becomes
# `stale` with a diagnostic reason, which unblocks the task's automation but is
# recorded as "we do not know", never as "CI was green".

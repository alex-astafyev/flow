# SkillsRegistryService — the install use case for registry skills.
#
# Transport lives in Skills::RegistryClient; this class turns a registry id into a
# Skill record. Resolution order for a skill's SKILL.md:
#
#   1. skills.sh download endpoint — the registry's own answer, whole bundle + hash
#   2. RFC 8615 well-known discovery — for publishers hosting their own skills, whose
#      ids have only two segments ("open.feishu.cn/lark-doc") and which the download
#      endpoint therefore cannot address
#   3. GitHub raw — for repositories the registry does not carry
#
# ONLY PUBLIC ENDPOINTS ARE USABLE. skills.sh's documented `/api/v1` surface
# (leaderboard, curated, search, detail, audits) authenticates with a Vercel OIDC
# token minted per Vercel project and issues no keys to anyone else, so a bearer
# token would only ever get a 401.

  # (10s each) is ~200s in the worst case. Puma's default `worker_timeout` is 60s and

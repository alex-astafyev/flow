    # WHO a launched run belongs to — which is not the same question as who was
    # allowed to launch it.
    #
    # `run.user` is what the run SPENDS: SessionService.create_for_workflow_step
    # reads it to choose the agent credential, the agent runtime and the model,
    # so it decides which account executes the work and which one is billed. The
    # work on a card belongs to the person the card is assigned to, so that is
    # who owns its runs.
    #
    # Which is why the person who ACTED is the wrong answer even when there is
    # one: whoever pressed Run, or dragged the card into an automated column, may
    # simply have been tidying the board. Moving somebody else's card is an act of
    # housekeeping; the work it kicks off is still theirs.
    #
    # This also has to hold because the agent side already assumes it: every
    # session tool resolves its own actor as `task.assignee || workflow_run&.user`
    # (InternalTools::BoardMoveTask and friends), where `workflow_run` is the run
    # of the session doing the work. A run owned by the wrong account therefore
    # has an agent that moves every unassigned card as that account, firing more
    # runs owned by it, whose agents do the same — so one wrong owner does not
    # stay one wrong run, it walks the board. Resolving ownership in ONE place is
    # what keeps every entry point (the card's Run button, the personal MCP tool,
    # a column auto-trigger) from having to get it right separately.
    #
    # `requested_by` remains the fallback for an unassigned card, and every
    # caller records it in the event's data, so "who asked" is never lost.

    #
    #   - no active membership in the task's company — it is not theirs to run;
    #   - the viewer role — the platform refuses to let a viewer launch a session
    #     at all, so attributing a run to one smuggles in work they could not
    #     have started themselves;
    #   - no agent credential in that company — and this one is the reason the
    #     check exists rather than trusting the assignee blindly. A nil
    #     credential is not an error anywhere downstream: SessionContextService
    #     writes credentials only `if credential.present?`, so the container
    #     comes up with nothing to authenticate as and the step dies with
    #     whatever the CLI says about being logged out. Handing a run to someone
    #     who never connected an agent would trade a wrong-account run for a
    #     silently broken one.
    #
    # Note the residual case this does NOT cover: a candidate who holds some
    # credential but not the runtime the step pins (`required_agent_runtime`)

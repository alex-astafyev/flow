# Unified OAuth 2.1 flow engine (generalizes Web::Integrations::SlackOauthController).
# There is ONE redirect URI per deployment; the provider is carried in the PATH on
# /authorize and in the SIGNED state on /callback, along with all other routing
# data. PKCE is mandatory (OAuth 2.1) and the code_verifier never leaves the server.
#
# Security guards (callback): (1) state signature + 10-min TTL, (2) single-use
# nonce, (3) double user-pinning (signed + cached), (4) mandatory PKCE/S256,
# (5) owner authorization bound to what the current user may act for,
# (6) open-redirect-safe return_to, (7) token-free error logging, (8) cancel
# handled before the nonce is consumed so the user can retry within the TTL.
#
# MCP OAuth (oauth-unification §5): #mcp_connect discovers + dynamically registers
# a client (MCP::OauthDiscoveryService) then runs the same consent flow; the
# callback loads the signed DCR client (constrained to source:"dcr") and threads
# the RFC 8707 resource indicator through the exchange. A DCR token_endpoint is
# attacker-authored, so it is re-validated against the SSRF guard at exchange time.

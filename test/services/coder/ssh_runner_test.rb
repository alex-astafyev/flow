    #      without it the CLI rejects the trailing tokens (`wanted 1 args but
    #      got N` / `No containers found!`), which broke coder_ssh_exec
    #      end-to-end (task #284, asset wf_output_20260623-1-7hx199.md).
    #   2. The command must be the SINGLE token right after `--` — NOT wrapped
    #      in `sh -c`. `coder ssh` space-joins its post-`--` argv before
    #      forwarding to the remote login shell, so an extra `sh -c` wrapper
    #      collapses the boundaries and corrupts any quoting inside the command
    #      (e.g. `echo "a b"` ran as an empty `echo`). See issue-coder-ssh-exec.md.

# Authorization matrix for the company-level Sessions::Artifacts controller, via
# the shared AuthorizationMatrix harness (docs/testing.md §2).
#
# Policy (Web::Company::Sessions::ArtifactsPolicy) is plain-permissive:
#   index?  => true
#   review? => true
# So the policy admits every persona; the real gate is record scoping in the
# controller (`company_sessions_scope`): a session is reachable by ANY member of
# the company that owns it (session.user in company.users OR session.project in
# company) and is scoped out (404) for a user of a different company. There is no
# read_only gate here, so the external viewer may review too — both actions are
# "any company member", not project- or admin-scoped.

    #       instance (User#active_memberships), so it stays one query however
    #       many policies and permission props the request builds.
    #   +1  Project#accessible_by?, which used to be an integer comparison and
    #       is now a membership lookup. Deliberately NOT memoized — see the
    #       comment there; a stale answer would grant revoked access.
    #   +1  the companies preload behind the current-user `memberships` prop,
    #       which feeds the company switcher. There was no membership list to
    #       serialize before, so this has no pre-membership counterpart.
    #   +1  the users.last_company_id write that makes the switcher choice
    #       survive a new session. Once per session, on the first request that
    #       resolves a membership — which a test always starts fresh, so it is

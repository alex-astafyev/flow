# Policy (Web::Company::Projects::IntegrationsPolicy):
#   index?                                   => project_accessible?   (read)
#   create? / destroy? / slack_oauth_start?  => manage_integrations?  (write)
#     manage_integrations? = project_writable? && (current_user.admin? || project_owner?)
#
# DIVERGENCE from the generic project-write preset: writes require admin OR the
# project owner, so the employee *collaborator* — writable in the generic sense —
# is DENIED here alongside the read-only viewer. Only the owner and a company
# admin may manage integrations, hence the custom MANAGE matrix below instead of
# assert_project_write. Non-members are still scoped out to 404 before the policy.
#
# Allowed-write response shapes (no vendor stubbing — every real provider path in
# #create hits an external API, so we exercise the only vendor-free branches):
#   slack_oauth_start -> 302 redirect to Slack's consent URL, no flash alert
#                        (default :allowed_write web shape: redirect + nil alert).
#   create (unsupported provider) -> 302 redirect carrying flash[:alert]
#     "Unsupported provider: ..." — a deterministic body-level guard that proves
#     authorization already passed (denied roles never reach the body). Because
#     that alert is NOT the authz denial, we assert it with allowed_status: :redirect
#     to skip the default "no alert" check.
#   destroy -> 302 redirect with flash[:notice] (not :alert), so the default holds.
